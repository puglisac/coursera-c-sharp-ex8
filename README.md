# Exercise 8: Rolling the Dice

This is an exercise for the coursera course [Introduction to C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-programming-unity)

### Problem 1 - Create two dice

> Declare **die1** and **die2** variables and use the appropriate **Die** constructor to put new six-sided **Die** objects into those variables.

Use the help documentation I provided to figure out which constructor to use.

### Problem 2 - Tell the dice to roll themselves

Tell the **die1** and **die2** variables to roll themselves. Use the help documentation I provided to figure out which method to use.

Side note: The solution I gave you includes a **RandomNumberGenerator** class that's initialized in the **Main** method and used by the **Die** class when a die rolls itself. It's pretty common to have a random number generator that's used by the whole "game".

### Problem 3 - Print the top sides of the two dice and print their sum

Print the top sides of the two dice. Use the help documentation I provided to figure out which property to use.

Print the sum of the top sides of the two dice.

Hint: It's easiest to declare a variable that holds the sum of the top sides of the two dice, then print that sum.
